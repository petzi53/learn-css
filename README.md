# Learn Computational Social Science

This book collects my learning about Computational Social Science (CSS). I follow the online bookdown seminar [Computational Social Science --- A Tutorial in R](https://bookdown.org/markhoff/css/). The text "is intended as a theoretical and methodological introduction to computational social science". But the book also  coversall the practical lab sessions that I will follow with this project.
